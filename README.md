This data package comprises ensemble model averages of CMIP6 historical and ssp126 climate change projections for the seafloor within Argentinaâ€™s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Yearly means were calculated from five climate models: GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, CNRM-ESM2-1, and NorESM2-MM, as part of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The ensemble averages were computed for three time periods: 1950 to 2000 (historical), 2041 to 2060 (ssp126), and 2081 to 2100 (ssp126).
